                <p>Located south of Zurich, Bern and Basel, the <span class="highlight">Swiss Alps</span> are a haven for winter sports enthusiasts. While skiing, hiking and snowboarding tend to dominate this region, you'll also discover quaint towns, serene lakes and gorgeous scenery that can be experienced year-round. Luxury mountain resorts are available throughout the region as well, making it a playground for all sorts of travelers. Additionally, no trip to the <span class="highlight">Swiss Alps</span> would be complete without indulging in some warm, gooey cheese fondue and melt-in-your-mouth Swiss chocolate.</p>

                <h2>Rome</h2>

                <p><span class="highlight">Rome</span> is a can't-miss European city on any Italy itinerary. The aroma of fresh Italian cooking wafts through the alleys and stately historical sights stand proudly at every turn. No visit to Italy's capital would be complete without checking out the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the intricate Trevi Fountain on an informative guided tour. Plus, nearby St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City (famous for the great Renaissance artist Michelangelo's stunning frescos) are sure to impress.</p>

                <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/30/180130-138-4FC01CDD/Overview-Amsterdam.jpg?w=800&h=450&c=crop" alt="Amsterdam">
                <p>There's more to <span class="highlight">Amsterdam</span> than its notorious "coffee shops" and Red Light District. Spend the day cycling through the city's stylish streets (this Netherlands locale is so bike-friendly, it has more bikes than it does residents) before exploring noteworthy museums like the Van Gogh Museum, the Dutch Resistance Museum and the Anne Frank House.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Barcelona</h2>
                <img src="https://travel.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/8c65c6b/2147483647/resize/976x652%5E%3E/crop/976x652/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.usnews.com%2Fimages%2FParc_Guell_Gatsi_Getty.jpg" alt="Barcelona">
                <p><span class="highlight">Barcelona</span>, Spain's diverse architecture sets the city apart from other European destinations. Must-see attractions like Antoni Gaudí's Park Güell and Basilica de la Sagrada Família are beyond impressive, as are Palau de la Música Orfeó Catalana and the many medieval buildings in the Gothic Quarter.</p>

                <h2>Athens</h2>
                <img src="https://travel.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/07a290f/2147483647/resize/976x652%5E%3E/crop/976x652/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftravel.usnews.com%2Fimages%2Fparthenon_in_spring_YO4WAzQ.jpg" alt="Athens">
                <p><span class="highlight">Athens</span> was made for history buffs and architecture aficionados thanks to its world-renowned landmarks like the Acropolis, home of the legendary Parthenon temple, and Ancient Agora. However, there's more to Athens than its historical sites. The Greek capital's laid-back lifestyle and incredible food attract the masses just as much as its famous attractions do.</p>
